<span class="body-bigger">Stories and musings of a woman who can't decide between two diametrically opposed cultures, can't commit to a vocation, can't seem to locate her people, and can't land on a style of conduct in her affairs to save her life.</span>

Contains prose, poetry, quoted text, translated text, and credited images. These bits and pieces do not follow a chronological order of events, do not feature a coherent narration style or main characters, and can only promise to frustrate the reader.

No AI-generated stuff here. Unless, of course, David Foster Wallace or Kurt Vonnegut somehow had access to generative AI tools back in the day and it snuck in within quotes, i.e., I can't speak for the owners of the credited content, which are clearly marked. No AI translations either. I write mostly in English. When I need content translated, I translate it myself the old-fashioned way and include credit to the owners.

This site is merely an attempt at organizing the things I've been writing in a digital scrapbook. I write to deal with life, not to create content. I certainly don't presume to appeal to a mainstream audience.
