Two limes fall off a truck and immediately get stuck to the asphalt of Highway 94 just outside Lafayette, Louisiana. One could argue that they were trying to escape the fate waiting for them in the farmer's market to which they were headed in Baton Rouge.

<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"Mmph."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"Do you think it's possible that we'll be blown to the side of the road and live to become fully-grown lime trees?"</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"Chances are we'll be aromatized tire polish before we reach the end of this conversation."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"..."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"Oh come on, Eric, don't be a sourpuss."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"Maybe some kid will pick us up and take us home. We could end up in some nice lady's cherry lemonade."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"Ugh. Lemonade. Porches. Swings. Fucking Louisiana."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"What do you have against Louisiana?"</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"For one thing, if we were further up north we wouldn't have to worry about becoming a lame pink beverage. Pink beverages come in shot glasses in the north."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"What kind of lime are you? Everyone loves pink lemonade."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"Listen, Hamlin Sweet. I'm from Florida. If I'm in for a ride into some ape's digestive system alongside goddamn cherries, there better be bourbon involved."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"Haven't you ever heard the saying <em>when life gives you lemons, make lemonade</em>?"</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"When did the entire world agree on the assumption that lemonade is better than limes? And how is turning lemons into lemonade an accomplishment? Any idiot can squish a perfectly good fruit and ruin it. I'd like to see someone make lime out of lemonade. Now that would really be something."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"I like lemonades."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"Then there must be something seriously wrong with you. Necrophilia comes to mind."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"Oh go to hell, Diego."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"I don't need to. I'm the one who's belly up, so your beloved Louisiana sun will cook me inside out soon enough. You just wait and see. Look at you lying in the shade on your side with your ass up in the air. What are you, farting or something? Oh geez, where's a semi when you need one."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"You know you're toxic."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">"Possibly. But that's for the Department of Agriculture to know and consumers to find out."</span>
