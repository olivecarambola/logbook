I noticed Zhari's text way too late in the evening. You'd think that I'm tech-retarded but I just have a crappy phone that makes it way too easy to accidentally switch to airplane-mode. I called her and she invited me to come over. Ace was there too.

It was a hail mary of an evening. I love late night hangouts. There's something about leaving the house around the time that sensible people start making their way home. I feel just dandy. About myself, my life, and for some reason, my outfit. Even better when there's no commute involved except for walking. That walk is pure swagger.

The longer we talked, the more it became clear that Zhari and I had a lot in common, and our experiences in life led us to pretty much the same conclusions. Ace was exhibiting signs of feeling a little insecure, and frankly, slightly ganged up on. She made a remark about how at least she got to introduce Zhari and me to each other, as if she were already out of the picture. And that gave me an idea to try and untangle a social concept: Introverts vs extroverts. I know. Hardly fresh, but hear me out.

Everyone knows by now that introverts need recharging between social outings. But what if that's because they act like reserves, not only in the sense that their social energy is finite, but in terms of their role in conversations, too? If you put two of them next to each other, nothing happens. Zhari and I are people who have much to share with similar stories, but we don't have much of a prompt to start exchanging them, at least not this early on in our friendship. We need a spark. That's Ace. She's all spark.

That's an oversimplification, of course. People are fluid, and they play many roles in many settings over the course of their lives. And sometimes two introverts come together and their conversation becomes a maze with sidetracks and stops, a yarn of anecdotes rarely followed to the end, because they keep sparking each other. But in the spirit of that particular evening, the metaphor held up: Zhari and I were two pools of fuel, and Ace was the sparkler.
