Dear Spotify, for the love of god, can you add a bar we can easily sweep with "x% you" on one side and "y% new" on the other or something? Some of us don't want to be punished in the same-songs prison forever for not feeling experimental for two consecutive hours, one time. I assure you, I still very much need new music. It's very neurotypical-normative of you to think that we all want that choice made for us. Asking for a friend, thanks.
