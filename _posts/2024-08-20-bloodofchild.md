You look at your children and see them in contrast with yourself. You're old, they're young. You know, they don't. You're what's been, they're what will be. You're cautious, they're delighted. Because you're covered in scars, and they're as unscathed as milk. They grow up, but never in your eyes. In your eyes, they stay as pink as they came. But your children will grow up one day. They'll take their beating, just like you. They'll work themselves wretched, they'll have their heart broken, they'll feel old and weary, just as much as you do. If they get knocked down and don't complain, most likely you'll feel validated. If they become men and women of their word, come what may, you'll be proud. Someone will admire them and say, your parents raised you well. So well, that even when they no longer want anything to do with this life, no more of whatever fresh hell this existence has to offer, they'll stick with it. They'll stick with living, and say nothing of their struggle. You won't suspect a thing. Because they will believe, harder than they believe in anything, that no parent should have to outlive their children. That no one deserves to watch their kids perish. Let alone parents who didn't live so their kids could. Parents who deprived themselves to the bone so that their children could taste comfort and plenty one day, least of all. It will be too late by the time you realize that they learned as much from your choices as they did from your words, and you led them by example to all sacrifice and no play. You'll regret it when you see that all they have to keep them going is their obligations. This is why it's your job as a parent to be happy, and selfish if need be, just as much as it is to be selfless. Don't burden your children to live for you too. How is it fair that they should have to live for many when they've never even learned to live for one?
