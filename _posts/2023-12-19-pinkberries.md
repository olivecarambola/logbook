It's like something catching your eye on the floor and you decide to take a closer look. You bend over and get on your knees, neck parallel to the floor, almost lying down. And then you realize that you're not staring at something small from a close distance, you're peering into a whole different world through a tiny hole. Or, say, you're in the passenger seat of a car traveling down a highway and you try to get a clear look at something to do with the car in the next lane. Instead of the uninterrupted focused view for which you're so yearning and squinting your eyes, you get a series of bright lights burning into your retinas as they're reflected from the surfaces you're passing by at high speed. Flash, flash, flash, and your eyes are ringing. It's as if your intense focus turns against you, magnifying your bedazzlement, and adding insult to your disorientation.

I simply notice the scent of the *dama da noite* blossoms on my way home, perfectly innocent, and decide to let it get a hold of my attention. That's it. I don't stop to smell the fucking flowers, I don't even walk closer to the flowers, I just inhale the air filled with their scent. That's all it takes for me to tumble down memory lane while I regret looking under that rock.

Why is it so hard to send this boy off into the great unknown? Is it because the memories are too fragrant?

Visions of wild pink, tangerine and lime, sunny, breezy Saturday mornings, red splatter over black, a touch of vanilla, a pinch of sea salt, standing in the middle of a crowd, standing in the middle of a room, standing in front of an open window, swinging in a hammock under the great open sky, picking fruits from trees, reciting grocery lists, road trips, other trips, gazing out the car windows at the great green mountains, singing to a darkening sky sitting by a tree, music in every moment, intensely absorbed, people losing their shit, people locked in on targets, people dancing, people posing, whiskey, negroni, beer, more people, make-believing, mermaid dreams, daybreak on a rooftop, long walks through alleys and parks, drives through cozy old neighborhoods, strangers with kind smiles, papaya, milk jam and cheese on toast, tea with milk and honey, cocoa on the stove, Jack Daniel's in the cocoa, wine stain on the white shirt, the tattoos, the high, the bliss, and the fall.
