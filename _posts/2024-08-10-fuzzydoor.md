Last night I dreamed I was part of an art collective living in a house. It was an artist's house - messy, free spirited. The perfect compromise between utility and grace. I wasn't there for long when I had to go out for a quick errand. I think the artists who lived there more or less liked me, but I wasn't sure. These bohemians had known each other for a long time, much longer than I knew them, and they were already quite set as a unit. I wanted to complete my task well and quickly to get on their good side, but I couldn't find my way back to the place. I kept walking the charming neighborhood up and down, looking for a door that resembled the one I remembered, the door whose image was quickly fading in my memory as I grew desperate. The worst part was that the longer I spent searching for the place, the more I could feel that the purpose of my leaving was becoming irrelevant, and so was I. A suspicion of not fitting in, a fear of not being missed that I had banished from my mind so long ago, so decisively that it's not allowed into my thoughts anymore if I can help it. So it sneaks into my dreams. Because I've learned the hard way that if anyone makes me uneasy with the feeling that I'm not welcome in their company, the best course of action is to leave and never come back. They can go fuck themselves and shove their precious little clique up their condescending asses. If there's doubt, there's no doubt. It'll never fit right, it'll never feel safe, it'll be a waste of my time. Whatever I get out of it won't be worth going through the anticlimactic end it will inevitably reach. But every once in a while, that insecure girl, embarrassed of her awkwardness and afraid that her weird ways won't sit well with the room, that little girl whose desire to belong is just painful, shows her uncool hairdo and funny eyebrows through the gap of the door, peeking, eavesdropping, and wishing with both hands' fingers crossed, to be invited in.
