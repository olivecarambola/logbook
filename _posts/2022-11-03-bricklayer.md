In the early 2000s, when more and more people were getting infatuated with the wonders of the internet but our lives weren't yet ruled by social media, some of us took to sending group emails once or twice a week with the funniest posts we read. In those years, I came across a man's account of how he got injured in a construction incident. I had not laughed that hard while reading ever before in my life.

Unfortunately, since these emails were compiled entirely by people and not by algorithms, credits were often omitted and it was almost impossible to track the owner of the content. So I didn't know whether it was a real account or fiction, whether it was in the news or a book, or anything else about the story. It was sad, but I had to let it go.

About 20 years later, I was having dinner in the *padaria* near my house and reading a book, as I do every night after work on my way home. And there it was. The same story, except in English. The first one I read was in Turkish, and unlike the original, it was complete. I have to give it to the translator, whoever it was. Because they did such an amazing job with the localization that I'd never questioned the assumption that this was a story about a Turkish construction worker.

Turns out, it was an excerpt from none other than David Foster Wallace's famous and infamous *Infinite Jest* (1996):

<span class="text-body-quote">Dear Sir:

I am writing in response to your request for additional information. In block #3 of the accident reporting form, I put "trying to do the job alone", as the cause of my accident. You said in your letter that I should explain more fully and I trust that the following details will be sufficient.

I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, March 27, I was working alone on the roof of a new six story building. When I completed my work, I discovered that I had about 900 kg. of brick left over. Rather than laboriously carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley which fortunately was attached to the side of the building at the sixth floor. Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the brick into it. Then I went back to the ground and untied the rope, holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 900 kg of bricks. You will note in block #11 of the accident reporting form that I weigh 75 kg.

Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor I met the barrel coming down. This explains the fractured skull and the broken collar bone.

Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulleys. Fortunately, by this time, I had regained my presence of mind, and was able to hold tightly to the rope in spite of considerable pain. At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel from the force of hitting the ground.

Devoid of the weight of the bricks, the barrel now weighed approximately 30 kg. I refer you again to my weight of 75 kg in block #11. As you could imagine, still holding the rope, I began a rather rapid descent from the pulley down the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles and the laceration of my legs and lower body.

The encounter with the barrel slowed me enough to lessen my impact with the brick-strewn ground below. I am sorry to report, however, that as I lay there on the bricks in considerable pain, unable to stand or move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I again lost my presence of mind and unfortunately let go of the rope, causing the barrel to begin a</span>
