Tchau Brasil  
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">bless your land</p>
<p style="text-indent: 4em;">your people</p>
<p style="text-indent: 4em;">and your spirits.</p>

Thank you Brasil  
&nbsp;&nbsp;for the most random  
&nbsp;&nbsp;but wonderful memories  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the highs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lows  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the trips  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the tattoos.

Keep fighting Brasil  
Keep your riches  
  I'll miss your unique heartbeat  
    your colors  
    your miraculous trees  
    and their quirky fruits.

Goodbye São Paulo  
  I'll be forever grateful to have found here  
    more of my family  
    and new reasons to love living.

Stay crazy São Paulo  
  one day I might just come back to your  
  devil-may-care way of being.
