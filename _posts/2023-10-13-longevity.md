You are obsessed with lengthening your life, maintaining your physical prowess, health, and beauty. Everything you do is to hold onto your youth and comfort for as long as you can. You've got your aging under control in all aspects that are deemed sensible. But what are you doing in preparation for your spiritual aging, really? You do everything right to minimize your chances of getting cancer, but what about bitterness? What about loss of appetite for life, for learning, for growing? What are you doing to delay the day when your collected wisdom comes for your courage to take a chance, and swallows whole your willingness to experience things that can still penetrate you? What's your retirement plan for meaning and purpose? Once you achieve your ideal day, how are you going to protect yourself from becoming an empty husk doomed to live that day over and over again for the rest of life, which is a lot longer now, thanks to your efforts? Because if you're under the impression that that's not a thing, that you're not going to turn into a monologuing senile who can't shut up about the golden days, or that you're going to stay as lighthearted as you are now without making an effort, then - I'm sorry to be the one to inform you, but you're in for a rude awakening. Be ready to join the ranks of dead eyed people, generation after generation, who successfully lengthened their lives, but forgot to keep the machine oiled well enough to call it *living*.

I'm not doing anything particularly effective to get ahead of this type of aging myself, I'm just tired of the smugness of the people who tell me that I'm living my life wrong just because they're confident that they're in a position to. I'd like to point out that they're not exactly doing a bang-up job of it either, because I'm in a position to. I'm a female writer. Hear me bitch.
