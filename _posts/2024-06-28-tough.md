It's always annoying when you realize people pity you. But it's especially annoying when they pity you while you don't see yourself in a position to be pitied. I have half a mind to straight up punch the next person who tells me to grow a thicker skin. I'd like to watch them bleed and tell them to grow tougher blood vessels.
