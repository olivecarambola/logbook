I've been staring at the world passing outside my window for about three hours now. Other passengers have long lost interest since the sunset colors began fading into a grayscale. Landscapes in the dark are by far the most underappreciated of all pastoral subjects. They don't grab one's attention easily. Their value requires active participation and focus from the viewer to be appreciated. But I've trained in the art through hundreds of hours of gazing at the line between the dark terrain and the dark sky, on account of the countless overnight road trips I took with my family growing up, with a little help from my lifelong insomnia.

<div class="left-line">
<em>You feel bad because you ended things so unceremoniously, so carelessly, as if she meant nothing to you, even though she must have meant something to you, at least a little, at least at some point. You feel guilty because you encouraged her to love you knowing exactly how it was going to end. And love you she did. She loved you from a place where reason isn't allowed in, and self-preservation is just out of reach.</em>

It wasn't until recently that I noticed, but not everyone prefers a window seat. Not everyone wants to look out the window just because it's there. Some people want to be closer to the exit or the bathroom. Others need constant entertainment. People want to chat, read, listen to music, watch shows, do crossword puzzles, or they just want to sleep. Me - I can keep staring at the line that may or may not be where I think it is because it's so dark. No music, no books, no conversation, wide awake. The heavier the mind, the longer I can look out the window, motionless. I need the world to roll through my field of vision for the same reason I need to doodle when I'm listening: It's a background mental task to my main mental task, which is untangling the ball of yarn that is my thoughts and feelings, hopelessly tied in knots trapped inside my skull.

<div class="left-line">
<em>And this is my gentleman caller. Except he's not even in the ballpark of a gentleman, nor does he ever call.</em>

If it so happens that I'm traveling with a light heart, I still look out the window because I try to choose staring at the real world over staring at a screen whenever I can, just out of pity for that neglected part of my brain that is still waiting for the days of tribal living and riding to return. And it's just so perfect tonight. My window is large and it's not obstructed by a window frame or stupid curtains. The lights inside the bus are low. The view outside the window is interesting to me because I've only lived in the subtropics for less than a decade and what's mundane for the locals is still quite exotic to me. Not that any of that matters. I can do the same taking the subway. Watching the lights in tunnels pass by does the trick, too.
