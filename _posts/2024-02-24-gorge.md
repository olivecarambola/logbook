Stomach vs Brain 2 days into the unemployment that came after 5 years in an abusive work environment:

<p class="text-customspace">Stomach: “Sweets, again?”</p>
<p class="text-customspace">Brain: “This time with black tea, because it's the perfect time for it in the afternoon. The light is just right.”</p>
<p class="text-customspace">Stomach: “But you were having coffee with sweets just before you started this meal, the one that you've just finished.”</p>
<p class="text-customspace">Brain: “Yeah, I don't know what to tell you. This is happening.”</p>
<p class="text-customspace">Stomach, crying: “I can't take this no more.”</p>
<p class="text-customspace">Brain: “Yeah, yeah, can you weep and digest at the same time?”</p>
<p class="text-customspace">Stomach: “Fine… Hic! I hate you.”</p>
