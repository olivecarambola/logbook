I have a bad case of the recently-got-laid brain. Fire is coming out of every orifice of the dump that is my life, and I'm checking my phone every 5 minutes for messages from a lost boy. You silly, silly girl. There's an ass to your left, there's an ass to your right, there's an ass in every direction for 1000 miles. You don't need to go look for them. Move along and they'll bump into you. Now back to work.
