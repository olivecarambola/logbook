The most valuable thing I've picked up in my 30s must be the ability to comfort, for now I've got the perspective to back it up when I say "it will be okay". If only I had the power to use that ability on myself. When do women get a clear view of themselves? As in, understand where they fit in the world, how good they're at what, nothing more, nothing less? 20s seem to be for immensely underestimating ourselves, 30s are for catching on and possibly going a tad overboard, maybe 40s? 50s? Oh god, please don't say 60s.
