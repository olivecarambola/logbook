<span class="text-body-bigger">Stories and musings of a woman who can't decide between two diametrically opposed cultures, can't commit to a vocation, can't seem to locate her people, and can't land on a style of conduct in her affairs to save her life.</span>

Contains prose, poetry, song lyrics, book passages, occasional images, and so on. These bits and pieces do not follow a chronological order of events, do not feature a coherent narration style or main characters, and can only promise to frustrate the reader. This is merely an attempt at organizing the things I've been writing and collecting into a digital scrapbook. I write to deal with life, not to create content. I certainly don't presume to appeal to a mainstream audience.

Most of the content is mine, some of it is not. Sometimes I like to translate other people's work. But anything that is not mine is meticulously annotated and credited. No AI-generated crap here. Unless, of course, David Foster Wallace or Maya Angelou somehow had access to generative AI tools back in the day, i.e., I can't speak for the owners of the credited content. No AI translations either. I write mostly in English but when I want something translated, I do it myself the old-fashioned way. Why should AI have all the fun?

Might be vulgar at times. See [About](https://olivecarambola.github.io/logbook/about/) for more fair warnings.
