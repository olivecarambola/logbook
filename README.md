# Olive & Carambola

This is a minimalist, content-focused personal site built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the Jekyll theme [Architect](https://github.com/pages-themes/architect), with heavy customization. It showcases my original writing and occasional third party content.

## Structure

- `index.html` / `home.html` – Home page, summarizing the intent of the site
- `about.md` – Disclaimer, copyright notice, and contact email
- `_posts/` – All content posts in Markdown
- `post_leaf.md`, `post_all.md`, `post_search.md` – Pages for navigating posts
- Custom layouts:
  - `allposts.html` – Lists all post titles with summary toggle
  - `searchposts.html` – (WIP) Search interface
  - `posts.html` – Post detail view

## Credits

- Based on the Jekyll theme **Architect** by Jason Long.
