Today I was walking home from the grocery store wearing a top that shows a lot of skin, and I noticed a look on a man's face as he was walking past me. I traced his eyeline and arrived at my right boob. Can't say I blame him, it's my bigger boob. But it's worth noting that both my boobs put together wouldn't make one decent cup size. Not that that should be a factor.

I'm genuinely impressed with the progress made in my hometown within the last decade with the casual daytime verbal and physical harassment a woman is subjected to any time she takes to the streets. The number of comebacks must have increased enough to teach men that it's just not worth the headache and they should just hold their tongue and enjoy the view. But I doubt the world would still be turning by the time a Turkish man learns to be cool when they check someone out.
