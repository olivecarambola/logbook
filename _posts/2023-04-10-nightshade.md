I've been staring at the world passing outside my window for about three hours now. Other passengers have long lost interest since the sunset colors began fading into a grayscale. Landscapes in the dark are by far the most underappreciated of all pastoral subjects. They don't grab one's attention easily. Their value requires active participation and focus from the viewer to be appreciated. But I've trained in the art through hundreds of hours of gazing at the line between the dark terrain and the dark sky, on account of the countless overnight road trips I took with my family growing up, with a little help from my lifelong insomnia.

<em>You feel bad because you ended things so unceremoniously, so carelessly, as if she meant nothing to you, even though she must have meant something to you, at least a little, at least at some point. You feel guilty because you encouraged her to love you knowing exactly how it was going to end. And love you she did. She loved you from a place where reason isn't allowed in, and self-preservation is just out of reach.</em>

It wasn't until recently that I noticed, but not everyone prefers a window seat. Not everyone wants to look out the window just because it's there. Some people want to be closer to the exit or the bathroom. Others need constant entertainment. People want to chat, read, listen to music, watch shows, do crossword puzzles, or they just want to sleep. Me - I can keep staring at the line that may or may not be where I think it is because it's so dark. No music, no books, no conversation, wide awake. The heavier the mind, the longer I can look out the window, motionless. I need the world to roll through my field of vision for the same reason I need to doodle when I'm listening: It's a background mental task to my main mental task, which is untangling the ball of yarn that is my thoughts and feelings, hopelessly tied in knots trapped inside my skull.

<div class="left-line">
<em>And this is my gentleman caller. Except he's not even in the ballpark of a gentleman, nor does he ever call.</em>
</div>

If it so happens that I'm traveling with a light heart, I still look out the window because I try to choose staring at the real world over staring at a screen whenever I can, just out of pity for that neglected part of my brain that is still waiting for the days of tribal living and riding to return. And it's just so perfect tonight. My window is large and it's not obstructed by a window frame or stupid curtains. The lights inside the bus are low. The view outside the window is interesting to me because I've only lived in the subtropics for less than a decade and what's mundane for the locals is still quite exotic to me. Not that any of that matters. I can do the same taking the subway. Watching the lights in tunnels pass by does the trick, too.

<div class="left-line">
<em>You are very settled in your ways, while skillfully maintaining the appearance of an open-minded, spontaneous guy. You probably have a bag of tricks. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that you have a playbook of sorts - a collection of scripted dates that make you look like you just came up with them on the spot. I suspect this, because you don't compromise. When confronted, you get almost comically defensive and start pulling every move from the standard issue toxic guy's hand manual to deflect the blame so you can stay where you feel safe. You stand your ground. That's fine, I get that. But I wouldn't wanna trade places with you. Poor thing, you must be terrified of the day when you won't be able to scheme your way out of these. I don't respect it - it's cowardly - but I get it. So you can go ahead and stand your ground. But then I'll just, you know, stop standing over here and go back to my own ground, like, way over there.</em>

I'll never stop finding it fascinating how even with a seemingly pitchblack sky, you can always tell where the mountain ends and the sky begins. Wouldn't it be hysterical if one day we all found out that I actually can't. I try to limit my self-deceptions to the parts of the picture where the lacking bit of information is either indefinitely unavailable or inconsequential. If you're never gonna see this person again, what difference would it make to know exactly how things went down? Or what they were thinking? That way, I take no risks when I fill those gaps with colors and compositions of my choice, and that makes all the difference between a messy pile of isolated events and a wholesome portrait, a story, complete with a unified theme and a sense of meaning. But what happens when no pattern fits? When no colors in the zones of the unknown provide a smooth transition between the zones of the known? Or worse - what if I can never stop trying to figure out the boy who held me as tightly as if I were his lifeboat and forgot me no sooner than I left his field of vision?

<em>Do I just write the whole thing off as a lie? Was the whole thing a colossal waste of time? What is it about heartbreak rooted in rejection that makes a girl wanna jump to the worst possible conclusions?</em>
</div>

I can spend hours accompanied by nothing but music and cigarettes. I can be alone with myself for days without getting bored. I made myself into my perfect companion but I couldn't bend myself into someone he desired. I found my way into the heart of the life that I've always wanted but I couldn't talk myself out of wanting what I couldn't keep. Every time I disappoint a man I love by turning out to be who I am, I disappoint myself a little as well.

<div class="left-line">
<em>You've grieved long enough. You've turned every stone, looked into every hole a hundred times over, turned this whole ordeal inside out. You're done. But you're afraid to let go and move on because that would mean stepping out of the controlled, safe, scripted environment you've created for yourself, a place where no surprises can happen. But sweetpeas, you gotta sweep away the dead leaves to sow new life, yeah? So let's get on with it.</em>
</div>

But then the disappointment goes away. Because in the end, I prefer having what I got to keep and who I got to become. I love the way I see the world. Even when it brings upon excruciating pain. Even when it takes me 200 km away to howl at the moon, and brings me back 3 days later without so much as a glance at the night sky. Especially then.
