“You'll be born. You'll work and sleep, starve and eat, you'll love and you'll hurt, smile and grieve. You'll grow up and you'll grow cold. When it's over, you can't take anything with you. No souvenirs. No clothes. Nothing for the road, nothing for after. So how do you want to spend this time? What will you collect? What do you deem worthy?”

“Can I take my spirit with me?” 

“I won't answer your question, but I'll give you a lifetime to ponder it.”

I've never understood the fuss about the big question: What's the meaning of life? How did something so obvious stump so many philosophers, give birth to so many religions, and even inspire scientific research?

It's love. For as long as I could remember, it's been love. I've always felt it, always chased it, been driven by it, I'm sure of it.

Not necessarily in the flower generation's <span class="text-body-quote">all you need is love</span> way, though, not only in the romantic sense. Although that one will knock your socks off. But no, love for… well, everything life has to offer. Love for a community, love for a nation, love for a person. Love for an idea, for a cause. Love for nature, for art, for science, for traveling, for discovering. Love for food. Love for sex. Love for power, for control, for a high, as misguided and destructive as it can be. For your friends, for your family, for your things, for your pet, for your garden. Love for a god, whichever it is. If you don't love what you do, you work so you can do what you love. Love for yourself - your body, your mind, your soul. For your life, or for all life. When everything else is gone, you carry on because you love living. Isn't that what keeps us, every single one of us, going? Whether it's selfish or selfless, spiritual or materialistic, whether it makes us or breaks us, it's the meaning of life. We are here to love. As much as we can, to live it to the fullest that we can. We go through crap so we can get to what we love. And when we lose sight of what we love, well... if you're resilient enough, and with some luck, the hope that you'll find something to love again, carries you through.

Maybe that's what the Beatles meant. It's inaccurate of course, you need a lot other than love. But if you don't love anything - what's everything else for?

I like to think that we can take love with us. It'd be almost like cheating death - because it's everything.
