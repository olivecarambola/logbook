One early September morning greeted me with a wave of longing. The wind blew the strings of hair left out of my updo on my face ticklishly, I wrapped my arms clad in an oversized whaleblue hoodie around myself, and doubled down while the memory of all the love I once had spread to all corners of my being. The bittersweet, less bitter than sweet, knocked me out so far out of my time and space that I could die of loneliness.
