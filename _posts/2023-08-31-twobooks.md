<span class="text-body-to-sal">I read this book when I was way too young to understand the political nuances it carries, yet it stayed with me because of its mystical, well-written story. So I leave it with you, my love, as a charm from a land far away, that is pretty on the surface, but filled with details that are only noticeable to those familiar with the millennia-old chaos that I call home. It's a combination of good literature, and strong, turbulent undercurrents, just like us.</span>

<span class="text-body-fr-sal">This is an amazing book from one of the greatest Brazilian writers. His sense of humor, his dark view of the world... All of that mixed with irony creates a strong and kinda grotesque, kinda beautiful story without meaning. In the end, he didn't learn anything, didn't leave anything, but he didn't perpetuate his failure to the next generation. The point? Well, it is a good story, like our love.</span>
