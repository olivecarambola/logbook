Stories and musings of a woman who can't decide between two diametrically opposed cultures, can't commit to a vocation, can't seem to locate her people, and constantly changes her mind regarding how to conduct herself in her affairs.

Contains prose, poetry, fiction, quoted text, translated text, and credited images. These bits and pieces do not follow a narrative, do not feature main or recurring characters, and can only promise to frustrate the reader.

[Posts](https://olivecarambola.github.io/logbook/posts/) on this site do not contain AI-generated text or images. Unless, of course, David Foster Wallace or Kurt Vonnegut somehow had access to generative AI tools back in the day and it snuck in within quotes. To be more precise, the original content posted on this site does not contain AI-generated text or images. I can't speak for the owners of the credited content.
