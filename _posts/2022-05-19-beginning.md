For 6 months, I felt dead.  
And not like a body in a morgue either.  
Not preserved, or recognizable.  
I felt like roadkill.  
Guts out, face torn, dried & blackened blood everywhere.  
As in, we gotta find a relative and get this girl identified from a specific body part or birthmark,  
DEAD.

But I wasn't dead. I felt all that pain.  
Then I felt better.  
Even hopeful.  
Then, I felt anger. That's when I knew I was making my way back.  
But you don't come back from that.  
You come back, but to something else.
