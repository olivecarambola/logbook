The spirit of winter doesn't come by your city. It passes through town sometimes, but it doesn't leave a mark the way it does in places where it comes to stay. You can tell that it's cold, and that it's been cold, just by glancing at the picture of a place when it's winter. The daylight is weak and silvery. Almost no living tissue of any life form is exposed. The way naked trees sway gives away how brittle and hollow they are. People are wrapped up in layers, hurrying to their destinations, looking inward. Animals scurry. You can sense that the spirit of things dwells deep, deep inside. Their flame is still burning, but away from all eyes, behind thick walls where the chill can't pierce. Taking shelter becomes not only a necessity, but a mindset. Saving up not only food, but also allies for times of scarcity ahead becomes a way of life. Your cold season feels more like being pranked by someone who doesn't get pranks. There's no way that you, the sons and daughters of the sun, the keepers of the Amazon, could ever relate to those from the lands with lasting winter.
