People think I want to become friends with them because I'm lonely and have nothing better to do. What they don't know is that the world inside my head can occupy all my time and then some. It's not too little, it's too much. But it's an unusual place with bizarre laws. I have enough trouble bridging my thinking with that of others. Without connections to the outside world, I'd wander off too deep into the woods. Come ground me.
