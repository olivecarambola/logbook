Lifehack: Since I moved back home, anytime I find myself about to spend way too much time on a task that is clearly not worth it, I repeat these words: <span class="annotated" data-note="Rick and Morty, season 2, episode 9, “Look Who's Purging Now”, 2015.">Jerry get a job</span>. Works like a charm. Available as a mental audio clip in Beth's or Summer's voice (equally devastating). Applicable to picking fights with stupid strangers online, handcrafting projects on crap that you won't even remember why you kept when you find it in the back of your closet a year from now, and everything else that can fill up your day after which you ask yourself how a full day flew by and all your actual responsibilities still await your attention.
