I wonder  
am I the first person who wants to stay awake all the time  
I wish I had all hours of the day to myself  
not have to eat, not have to sleep, never get sick ..  
just do things I wanna do all the time  
and still have time to maintain my job  
and enjoy my cigarettes and weed  
my music my series  
my writing my drawing  
and you  
I would only want to sleep when I get to sleep with you
