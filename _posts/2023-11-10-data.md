Yes I do have a problem actually with you labeling me and adding me to your data sets, or adding anyone else to your data sets for that matter, even if you're never going to sell them for profit, because you are still going to exploit them at my expense without having to admit to malicious intent. Because anonymity, in the end, is the only true level equalizer. I'm all for equal ground, because I'm confident that I would still come out on top if I were to take that bet. Are you?
