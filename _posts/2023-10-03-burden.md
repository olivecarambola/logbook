He was possibly the most repressed functional adult I have known and will know intimately. He was a poster child for toxic masculinity directed at men. Of course it's unavoidable that any woman who gets involved with him will eventually be exposed to that toxicity. I still got the better end of the deal, though, in the end. Because as heavy as my wounds are, and as unrecoverable as my loss is, I could, and did, get out. He has to either fix himself, or live with himself until he dies. And neither one of those prospects is pleasant or easy, lemme tell you. Me - I've carried this burden long enough. I'm putting it the fuck down.
