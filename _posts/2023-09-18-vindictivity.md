Never cross a writer. You won't know when, you won't know where, but something brutal will be written about you. It may never be published, it may never even leave a locked box, but it'll be out there, for anyone to find and read, if not now, someday. Names might be different, the story may be altered, or the whole thing might be an ambiguous blob of narrative, a collection of subtle hints here and there, but it'll be unmistakably about you. And if the writer is worth their salt, it will be devastating. Your assholery will be chiseled into history forever in all its glory, the fury at its injustice ready to be reawakened at will, at any given moment. In the absence of all the layers that used to sugarcoat the truth for your fragile ego's protection, you will be frozen in time at your vilest, portrayed in the most ridiculing, unforgiving light. The one-sided narrative and the fact that there won't be a thing you can do about it, or any means for you to respond, will drive you up the walls. Because a characteristic that most assholes share is the passion to build a magnanimous image of themselves to which they can masturbate. They care about the myth of the man more than who the man actually is, certainly much more than how they treat other human beings. Oh, the delicious irony. It'll be too late to save your precious reputation now, offenses long sealed and archived, not to mention responding or denying would mean getting into a whole thing, which you didn't have the balls to do in the first place. You'll have passed over your only chance to respond to the allegations. Isn't literary vindication divine? If you screw me over and lock me out like a coward, the least I should get to do is stop draining myself to spare you, and let go of the leash that kept my demons from tearing you apart.
