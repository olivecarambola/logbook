<span class="text-body-credit">"A Brave and Startling Truth" by Maya Angelou, delivered at the 50th-anniversary commemoration of the United Nations in 1995 and published later that year. Presented alongside the photograph of Earth taken by the *Voyager 1* space probe on February 14, 1990, which Carl Sagan titled "[Pale Blue Dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot)".</span>

<span class="text-body-credit">The reason this poem and this photograph are placed together here is the powerful impact that yet another article by Maria Popova, the author of The Marginalian, has made on me: "[A Brave and Startling Truth: Maya Angelou's Stunning Humanist Poem That Flew to Space, Inspired by Carl Sagan](https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/05/09/a-brave-and-startling-truth-maya-angelou/)", 2018.</span>
