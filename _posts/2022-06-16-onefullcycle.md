I like that sometimes you smile, even laugh to yourself, because you simply feel good. It's delightful when you giggle intermittently for the better part of an hour because you've just seen something you find hilarious. It's nice that you can be perfectly comfortable not talking for long stretches of time while driving and just listening to music, and I appreciate that you don't look annoyed when I start talking while you do that, even though it must get annoying sometimes. It's pretty cool how much you value and enjoy the company of your friends, the way that most of us did when we were kids, but forgot how to over time. I like that in a minor crisis, say, when my blood pressure drops or I get nauseated, you don't waste time and do what needs to be done, calmly and effectively. And that you don't hover when I go off and do whatever I need to do to take care of myself. Most people don't believe that I can.

But I think my favorite is that, although you barely seem to retain memories from our time together, you keep surprising me by saying things that show you know and understand me at a very core level. I love feeling like who I am and what I do makes sense to you. Maybe I'm still learning about who I am, and maybe it helps to see myself through you, and I like feeling like that's alright, too.

And as charming as I think it is, I won't stop teasing you about the fact that you're a grown ass man who climbs trees to pick fruits. You're just gonna have to get over it.

If there's one sound I recognize in this world, it's the sound of shutting down.

He had been breaking my heart little by little, on most days, for quite some time. As I was leaving the hospital, picking up my meds from the pharmacy, and heading to the office to work my way through a nauseated, dizzy, feverish day, it started to dawn on me that the physical pain would likely outlast the relationship that led to it.

It was no secret that he had troubles. But so did I. I just couldn't wrap my head around why we couldn't talk to each other about them. <span class="annotated" data-note="[Acının tesellisi acıdır.] From the book ''Oğullar ve Rencide Ruhlar'' by Alper Canıgüz, 2004.">Suffering consoles suffering</span>, no?

But surely we couldn't do that. Because I was supposed to be a strong, somewhat independent woman, and he was, or at least got remarkably good at playing the part of, an individualistic, womanizer paulistano who can't be caught dead feeling romantic attachment to a girl in any real, meaningful way.

The worst part was that I knew exactly what was going on. The outrageous fact of the matter was, I'm exactly the same. I did it countless times, and given the chance, I'll do it again. Hell, I was probably doing it that very week. He had me, and he knew it. Ergo, there was no more chase to give him the thrills.

Humanity needs to end, now. If not for what we did to earth, or what we did to one another century after century, millennia after millennia, then for what we do to each other still, every single fucking day, knowing all that we know. We all need to drop dead this instant.

**Echo** `|` **September**

It all felt so pink at that moment.

It was a brilliant stroke of luck that I was in the company of friends, but didn't have to talk to them, and I got to choose the music but didn't have to worry about whether they liked it or not. I just laid on the hammock, high in the sky, swinging softly, listening to the songs that took me down memory lane, and I indulged myself in remembering our time together, thinking about you, and feeling the love. I did nothing else for a while.

You had my respect. You had enough of my trust. You certainly captured my interest - romantically and platonically - and god knows I cared about you. It's not like I made you my everything, but I did leave the door open for you to be anything. Anything you wanted to be to me. And this is what you chose. This is what you cashed it in for. This, *sweetie cake*, is on you.

A momentary lapse of insanity. Like a lamb heading for the slaughterhouse coming to her senses. Not today. This lamb is making a run for it.

You're the one who estranged yourself from me. You're the one who shut me out. From where I stand, welcoming people into your life and bidding them goodbye is as easy as changing your t-shirt to you. I'm not built that way. I take my time letting people in, but if I do, I let them under my skin. So now, while you take off this t-shirt and toss it aside I have to go and grow a new fucking skin. It takes time, and it hurts like a bitch. So kindly, stop jerking me around and respect me while I'm grieving.

**Void** `|` **March**

A black hole for care. Doesn't appreciate it. Doesn't return it. But keeps demanding it. I've exhausted the words and yet the feeling remains. There's no explaining it away, no ways around it, no skipping it, no shortcuts. I can't will myself into accepting it. It's inexplicable, unreasonable, and unacceptable. This blackhole will just have to stay where it nested in my psyche for as long as it pleases, bleeding me dry out of my strength. It will stop only when it scabs. And there's nothing I can do until it does.
