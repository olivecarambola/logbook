I thought we'd make good friends, but they're just another soul looking for someone to endorse their opinions and support their every decision, no matter how rushed, no matter how stupid. And they don't seem to be all that eager to learn from their mistakes, either.

Yikes, I outdid myself with that one. Cunt, much? What I left out, though - that's perfectly fine. In fact, I think everyone deserves to have a stupid decision period in their life, at least once. Some people simply need to have the experience to retain the knowledge. I'm one of them. And at their age, it makes sense. They're strong enough to take hits until they're motivated enough to start practicing self-preservation. I just thought that they were more mature than their age. Oh well, no harm done.
