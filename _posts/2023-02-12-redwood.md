Climb, climb, climb, higher and higher. Observe that you're now alone. Stand still in the middle of the storm. Try to make the shapes and shadows around you. Touch the gray membrane pressing against the faces trying to cross over to your side. Do you recognize the faces? Are they friendly or hostile? Are they reaching out to you or trying to get you? Do they want to connect with you or tear you to pieces? Probably both, and not necessarily in that order. Who can tell. People act equally desperate doing those things. So which is this one doing? How long do you collect data before you decide? Do you have to decide? That one seems to be retreating. How long before it comes back? How long before it's gone for good? Take a guess. The closest guess to the last look wins. Was it ever real? Is a person who feels the sentiment *forever* in one moment but not in the next moment being truthful or lying? Was it worth it? Worth betraying yourself? Worth ignoring your inner voice? Was it your voice or someone else's? Once a belief is carved into your bones, who can tell who it belonged to in the first place. It'll come out of you whether you apologize for it or not. You might as well consider it your own. You might as well perpetuate it. Was it as good as you remember? Or were they just a few moments of bliss tied together with days and weeks and months of anguish and now you can't see clearly because your mind keeps sneaking in ever-changing soundtracks to accompany your memories when it plays them back to you. Try different themes and see your ordeal in different lights. Does it look better with a slow and heavy rhythm that highlights the points of trauma? Or with a light fast pace to reflect the sense of a spinning heart losing control? How about a motion sequence to capture the rush? Quirky tunes to paint yourself as a book character? Piano and strings for a portrait of crimson anger and tragedy? What about the theme - pastels & dark mattes for humor, black & white for sorrow, stripes & carousels for whimsy? Keep your brambles in check. They're growing again. Creeping up the ankle and encasing slowly anyone who's been standing in the same spot for more than a minute. Weird way to choose to live. Hacking off one's own extensions regularly to avoid forcing connections on innocent bystanders. You'd think that someone with this condition would, by now, either learn to stop growing or grow towards people who grow back. Or at least, grow slower. Screen harder. Choose better. Not you. You'd rather grow to your heart's content, and hack. And grow, and hack. Stop that. Stop wrapping yourself around it. That does not belong to you. Let it go. Hack. Take a walk. Choose a route. Choose - make money and sacrifice passion, or follow passion and sacrifice comfort. Go after dependable and boring or unpredictable and exciting. Or try your hand at the impossible and attempt to tame the wild? Purchase property or experience? Are you going to invest in your future tonight, or are you just going to knock your lights out and do whatever it takes to keep your sanity until bedtime? Who can even think with this incessant noise. Who can live like this. How is everyone else living like this. Two young men on the train have red teary eyes. They're not crying. The tear just won't drop. They're not saying anything. They're just looking ahead with unseeing eyes. It's haunting. Something truly awful must have happened to have two grown men show emotion in public without so much as giving a flying fuck. People have real problems. Context and all that. You couldn't survive in a fish tank. Have you always been this fragile? Have you always been this *much*? This heavy-of-soul? Are you actually carrying a heavy load or have you just never grown the muscles? Look at those tree roots all dried up and twisted up in knots. You can see the places where the wood has darkened and become a chafed-shiny, hollow, brittle version of its former self. You see the resemblance don't you. You've collected all this wisdom, a grown olive tree's worth, and you still don't know how to use it. You don't know how to own it, you don't know how to act it. You got old and frail without ever being youthful and strong. You can't possibly think you can get away with treating yourself like this forever. Have you always acted like the rules don't apply to you? Have you actually accepted the consequences of your dysfunction? Or was it just a good spin you put on your same old teenage rebellion that did the trick, the same phase from two decades ago that you sold as profound while everyone else was busy growing out of it? The moon is full tonight. The rainbow hue over the smoky dark gray and the bone-yellow almost makes it all worth it for the briefest of moments. You could actually rest tonight if you can ride this wave and stick with this calm. Maybe all those years really were your becoming. Or maybe you've only been delaying. Think about the check when the check arrives. Have you adjusted and learned to work smart or are you just lazy and simply not doing enough? You're a child. Have you always been this damaged and scared? Is it your parents' fault or yours? Are your reasons legit or are you just whining? You're an imposter. You tell yourself that you deserve better. Do you? You look like you've given up. Have you? You act like you're over it, and now it's time for you to shine. Are you? Depends. Turn your eyes to the east. Look over the frozen steppes towards the blue silhouette of the mountains. If the sun is rising, I'm a capable woman. I fight uphill and shoot and bleed on the go. I walk into a room full of opponents head-on and do what needs to be done. I'm a mama bear. Someone needs my help, I'm there. I rise to the occasion. Provided that I had enough time in the morning to sort out my morning blues and anxiety. Otherwise the badassary kicks in around noon. Now turn your eyes to the west. Greet the setting sun with a glass in your hand raised to the sea and its dark waves. Once the sky is done being set on fire and darkens deeper than whale-blue, my heart sets with it. The weight of decisions starts pressing. The responsibility starts crushing. You have four hours. This is your time of freedom. You can use it to be better - physically, emotionally, professionally, take your pick. You can talk to people you value, drink your social cup's fill, have fun, get yourself some nice memories. You could do anything you want - for four hours. If not, there are lists of lists full of to-do items still waiting for you to attend to. Shame, shame, shame if you just gave in to mindless entertainment and didn't even sleep early. Disgrace, if you didn't even make yourself a balanced meal. It's a relatively small responsibility in the grand scheme of things, but here's the trick: It comes back around every night. Not to mention every weekend. And if you don't use it well today, you probably won't tomorrow either. If you blanked out over a whole weekend with nothing to show for yourself, you'll probably do the same next week. And chances are, a whole year will pass by in the blink of an eye and you'll find that you're exactly in the same spot, just as stuck, doing the same things with the same people, except you'll be older but none the wiser, other than the larger repertoire of sarcastic comebacks. You'll be increasingly transparent in your bitterness. It's like water dripping on a boulder - be better, do better, until it's intolerable. Stop. I'm too old. I just want to *be* for a while. How do people live such busy lives while you need so much time just to unwind? What on earth is the matter with you? Will the questions ever cease. Will the search ever be over. Will I ever reach a steady state of content. With who I am and what I have and what I do. Or is what we consider a happy ending simply the peak after which things drag onto an uneventful, anticlimactic forever, and if you don't like it you're welcome to go back out there and start your search from scratch. Can anything or anyone ever truly keep giving? Or do they only give until they run out of juice and you run out of interest, and over time more of the same doesn't do it anymore? Is anything safe from becoming stale? I'm tired. I don't wanna keep climbing. I don't wanna keep hoisting myself upward with my life on my back. But I can't stay here. It's too hard and too mediocre to spend the rest of my days. Looking for new resources all the time, barely surviving from one to another. That's funny - it was wonderful just yesterday. Or was it that I'd just had my last hit? Pearls and strings, they say. What if I were to just let go?
