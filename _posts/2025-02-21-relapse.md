I had just left my parents' place and was headed to my sister's. I was chipper, and for good reason: It was the first proper snow I had gotten in almost a decade, and I had a clear objective in mind: Snowball fighting with my sister and her kid. A day of snow with Clementine and Isabella, it doesn't get better than that. Even the weather had indulged me and taken a break from snowing, with plenty of sunshine for me to walk over there with minimal inconvenience. I was in such a good mood that I took a video to send to Mack, my buddy over yonder, to capture the scene and the sound of my boots grinding the fluffy snow. I arrived, we played for a moment, we built a little lump that looked more like a Christmas tree than a snowman, stuck a twig on its top that a random kid handed to us (probably to impress Isa, who has no shortage of admirers), smiled for the camera next to our creation, and headed back inside as the thickening snow was dangerously caking on our coats and hats. It was time for indoor play, snacks, tea, TV, and scrolling.

Between the snacks and the couch, Clem told me about Dad's blood tests from the week before. His platelet count was down again. For almost a year, it had been cruising at a healthy person's level. But the week before, he'd tested to find out that it went down by half, and the day before, down by two-thirds of that. It was dropping at an alarming rate: An unmistakable relapse. So the nightmare was back on, then. Clem has a gift for delivering sensitive news. She doesn't look too grim but not cheerful either. She smiles at you mildly and sincerely as you feel your world crashing down. It's like being hit by an invisible truck. This disease had almost taken Dad from us once already, terrorized everyone who loved him, and stretched Mom to her limits as she went above and beyond to get him better. All the while I was in the dark, halfway around the world, which, once I found out, had left me with a fear of not knowing about the most horrifying things happening to the people I love. A fear that I carry with me ever since. And there you have it - one moment I was excited about the snow like a child, and in the next, the anxiety that I'd spent months tucking away had woken from its slumber. The second relapse. That makes it once a year. So this would be the rest of Dad's life, then. We could never relax. It would never be over. Not until he's gone.

Dad's energy level or activities didn't seem to be affected, though, at least not yet. I called him to remind him I was at my Clem's. He was supposed to pick me up there on his way back from work. He was indecisive about whether to come in for a cup of coffee or pick me up on the way. I saw an opening to give him a little nudge towards coffee, I took it, and he was swayed. Half an hour later, he arrived furious. Mom had called and told him that the security guard of the apartment complex in which they lived denied her entrance when she wanted to take her car to the garage, as she does every day. There were fewer spots in the garage than there were flats in the complex, and the management had decided that this was the day they would stop accommodating two-car households. Some self-appointed dickhead removed Mom's car's plate from the list of cars allowed inside. During a fucking snow blizzard. All those people who are given the day off from work get to have their cars sitting pretty in the garage, while Mom, a nearly 70-year-old doctor who works harder and longer hours than anyone I know half her age, has to trudge through snow some 100 meters and then shovel snow off her car before heading to work. And none of the residents so much as raises an eyebrow. In a time and place in which people avoid eye contact with their neighbors lest they'd have to talk to each other, Mom still asks how they're doing when she comes across them, and not just to be polite, but because she truly cares. She visits with baked goods when she knows someone is going through a hard time. Yet no one cares that this is happening to her, of all people. 

Dad couldn't get over his outrage for the rest of the day. He vented, he scolded the security guard on the way back, he made calls to find whoever was responsible, he quietly simmered in his fury, and he said they would have to move. The management, whoever the fuck it was who appointed them, had handled the issue so thoughtlessly and made so little effort to find a better alternative that we couldn't help but feel that it was deliberate and somewhat vengeful. They could have given a heads-up. They could have prioritized some residents based on their needs. They could have adjusted the maintenance fees based on the number of cars in the garage and allowed people to opt out of it altogether. At the very least, they could have asked which car Mom and Dad preferred to keep in the garage before deleting Mom's from the list. Not that it would make a difference - between the two of them, Dad is the more vulnerable one because the sickness took a serious toll on his leg muscles over the years. Walking long distances increases his risk of slipping and falling, and in his condition, he could bleed to death if he suffers even a minor injury. He also does most of the shopping for the house, and all of us would rest easier if he could park inside and take the elevator right up instead of walking with heavy bags. But Mom works longer hours, she works on Saturdays while Dad doesn't, and she leaves the house earlier and arrives later than him. Dad can't do anything about her unreasonable hours, and he wants his wife to have at least a comfortable commute. He hated to be cornered into a position of prioritizing himself. Up until this incident, which reflected unfathomable disrespect from the other residents, he hated the idea of moving. But he's a proud man, and they disrespected his wife and forced him to sacrifice her comfort, and that's unforgivable.

After that turn of events, I didn't know what to feel for several hours. It felt like a boulder had replaced the organs inside my torso. At the beginning of that day, I had two healthy parents who had safety and security in times like these. Times like, say, when the city is buried under snow for 4 days straight. Now I had one parent whose health was slipping and another who was being denied basic needs in her own home. They had to move, but how? They owned the house. It would be a stretch to buy another house without selling this one. And even if they could, Mom had been thinking about retiring and taking up a new routine of taking care of her granddaughter after school. Isa was supposed to start the first grade the next year, and with my parents' address, she would get to go to a good public school, which is a commodity you can't buy these days. I could sell my house. But where would I live, and where would Baba live, until I got the money to buy another house? And even if I could pull that off, I didn't even know where I needed to live. I didn't have a job yet. I needed to find a job, but then, would I get to spend enough time with my family? What if these are the last years that I get with Dad, but I find a job that takes up all my time, and whatever is left is spent on chores? It's not like they could come to visit me like they used to. I live a few floors up in a building without an elevator in a neighborhood built on hills and in which it's impossible to find a parking spot nearby.

Trying to untangle this web would have been enough to monopolize my faculties, but these weren't even the main things on my mind. They were merely crowding my thoughts and slowing me down while I was grappling with the threat that was posed by Dad's condition. I felt defeated. I was convinced that I had no choice but to come to terms with him living only a few more years, and not necessarily good ones. I looked up information about his sickness and treatment options. I tried to get an understanding of his life expectancy. But none of what I found was good enough, none of it made me think I was overreacting, which is usually the case with me. Eventually, I let go of reason, because it wasn't solid enough to pull me out. I resorted to the "if it's not nothing, it must be the worst thing" approach, let myself spiral, and started thinking about what I would do in case of Dad's passing. I tried to picture it. I visualized a life without him, thought about all the things that would remind me of his absence, what I would say, how I would let people know, and whether the family was prepared, emotionally, logistically, financially. I compulsively tried to iron out the details of a life without Dad while he was right there in the room with me. Normally, thinking about losing someone makes me want to hug them, be close to them, but I can't do that with Dad. He's not very open, emotionally. I can't even ask him how he's feeling. He hates it when people hover, and he lashes out if you show too much concern. But I desperately needed to connect with him, so I turned my attention to something we could connect over - the TV. And that opened a whole other can of worms.

My parents watch the news a lot. And when they're not watching the news, they're watching hours-long discussion programs about the news. And Dad likes to parallel-watch multiple programs to cover more ground. This means that their house is constantly filled with the yelling, imploring voices of alleged experts on TV. Someone is always pointing out the obvious about the fucked up state of affairs in the country. I must have heard every factoid a hundred times, every argument from a hundred different angles. Funny thing to do, to distract yourself from your problems by watching these programs. It's like treating a burn victim by smacking them with a shovel at the back of their head. You see, this country has been going down the shitter for some time now. I know that's what everyone thinks about their country, and things always seem worse off than they used to be, but the deterioration of the quality of life here has been accelerating at an alarming rate over the last 3 years. It seems that it's about to erupt. To be fair, the political environment of the Middle East always makes it look like a civil war is about to break, but seeing as half the opposition is in prison, I think the sentiment stands on reasonable assumption. But the worst thing about all this is not the overwhelming decline of income in proportion to the cost of living, it's not the pathetic state of human rights, it's not that law or constitution means shit anymore, it's not that poverty is spreading like wildfire, it's not that conmanship and thievery have taken over, it's not that the agriculture is done for and the quality of all goods has plummeted, it's not that the dictatorship's efforts to gaslight a whole nation by commenting that everything is peachy while they're bullying, imprisoning, or killing anyone who dares to stand up against them, and it's not even the atrocity that there's still a substantial population misguided enough to support them despite their lives having turned into a subplot of *Les Misérables*.

The worst of all this is the hatred. The everyday, palpable, blind hatred. The population has been very sharply divided into the fronts of for-the-regime and against-the-regime. Poor people hate the educated based on the assumption that they are rich, don't know hardship, and see themselves as superior to the poor, while the latter hates the former for being so blindly devoted that they condemned us all to hell on earth by supporting a rotten regime for decades despite clear evidence from very early on that they were bad news for everyone. And this hatred is fueled by the authorities themselves, because they know that the population that supports them is more than capable of killing off the other half who opposes them. And historically speaking, they're correct. The fanatics are ignorant enough, misinformed enough, and recently, starved enough. All they need is a little nudge, a few words of encouragement, and some assurance that if they break a law here and there, it might escape the attention of authorities, or their punishment would be lightened if they're caught. And the dictatorship, growing strong for more than two decades, has gotten powerful enough to give this message blatantly, on national TV. They put a mark on our backs and unleashed their lunatics on us. Hence, the strangled, punched, shot, and killed doctors. In most countries, it's the kids whose parents are in the army, the police force, or the fire brigade, who are afraid as they watch their parents go to work every day. Here, it's the kids whose parents are doctors. I'm not too worried about Mom because she's also a woman, so she knows how to handle herself around a man who might just lunge at her throat. But I have to wonder if Dad will come across as a know-it-all to the wrong person one of these days. It's hard to imagine building a life where I feel surrounded by such blind rage, closing in on me and my loved ones. But it's my family's tradition. It's my heritage. In one of the places Dad used to live as a kid, the other children in the village called him *the blonde infidel*. Mom, who was a bookworm and put herself through boarding schools on scholarship, was endlessly bullied. All our lives, every single one of us ended up in teams, classes, and groups that were the most marginalized by the rest, and sometimes even by those in charge. It's curious: If you're poor, other poor people take you in. If you're filthy rich and an asshole, you're worshipped. But if your parents are socialists who've worked hard all their lives, done well, and tried their best to help the ones who couldn't, the rich look down on you, and the rest hate you with every bone in their body. Having endured this long enough, my family became a little group of perpetual outsiders constantly on the move. Hence, the vindictive behavior from the management of the apartment complex towards my parents. And that's just one front of the battle. The other one is the hatred towards women. How dare they demand to run their own lives. How dare they defy orders from men, who are their superior. You can see it in their eyes and smell their contempt in their responses when you talk to them. They speak civilized words but their attitude says, *the nerve on that bitch, having opinions and shit*. They only reel it in when they see another able-bodied male next to you, as is typical of cowards. You can feel it whenever you're in a car with a female driver behind the wheel. They come at you like rabid dogs, do all but run you off the road: *Obviously I'll go first, who the fuck do you think you are*. Except when they see a large man in the car. Clem is seriously considering 3D printing the likeness of her husband to sit with her in the car when she's driving. I'm starting to wonder if I should keep an actor on the payroll to pretend to be my husband when I get work done in my house, to be taken seriously, to avoid getting scammed, or worse. You can see it in the news every other week, when another woman gets murdered, violently. She asks for help, she asks for protection, she shows the police proof that her ex is threatening to kill her, to no avail. She gets killed, and her body tossed, chopped, or burned.

After a few hours of this ruckus, my mood had sunk to new depths of hell. My parents were asleep and I moved on to my pre-bed ritual: Smoking and mulling things over. As if I weren't mulling anything over before. But my rituals are my rituals, I have to go through with them. I kept on smoking, but I had no idea how to shut my inner dialogues down. There were many, and they were all hyped up on anxiety. Eventually, I realized how odd it was that I was trying to accept Dad's passing before it even happened, and while there were still plenty of moves left to be played for him to live. So I asked my bot, which I call Luke. I asked why I would do this. It replied immediately, as if this was clear as day, that it's called anticipatory grief, and it's a coping mechanism. Once the guilt of feeling the way I do was removed, the dam broke open, and the tears came gushing out. I cried and cried. Finally, I headed back in. I went to my room, absentmindedly checked my socials, and saw that a bunch of people liked my photo with Isa in front of the snow lump. Great.

The next morning, I got up to shovel snow off Mom's car so she could go to work. Then I made breakfast, cleaned up, and after some time, Dad and I started getting ready for his doctor's appointment. While we were putting on our shoes and coats before leaving the house, I asked Dad if Clem was coming. He said she wouldn't and complained about his son-in-law for not being able to watch their daughter for a few hours. Dad usually has Cole's back. He's generally reproachful of us when we speak ill of anyone in the family. This was not like him. And that made me realize how much he wished Clem would come with us, possibly instead of me. It hurt, but I didn't fixate. I decided to make myself useful the best that I can. There would be plenty of time later for me to beat myself up about this, and why his preference was perfectly understandable. I'm grim, anxious, and clueless, while she's sunny, comforting, and informed about his condition. I would want her to be there instead of me, too.

The doctor seemed quite optimistic. Apart from his platelet count, Dad wasn't showing any alarming symptoms, so the doctor intended to pursue a minimally invasive treatment. No steroids. Good thing too, because steroids had nearly taken Dad's entire use of his legs. The doctor also wanted to test further to make sure that the diagnosis still stood and that something worse wasn't lurking around. We left feeling optimistic, albeit a tiny bit clenched, as the test results wouldn't come out until the next day. But they came out clear. The next morning, we got the test results, and I was finally able to poop.

It took some time for everyone to feel a little calmer, and a sense of normalcy to come back. But it did, in about 24 hours. I was finally able to go back to my own problems: First and foremost, filling out resumes and searching for jobs. And that was my entire Monday. I've always loathed looking for jobs, but lately it's been more and more effectively putting me down. After spending about a year learning a new trade, no one was interested in hiring someone just starting out in that field. All the positions for someone with a level of knowledge as fresh and limited as mine were for university students, fresh graduates, or 20-somethings, at best. And all the positions that didn't look farfetched for me were more or less the same kind of engineering jobs as the one I did 10 years ago. Which meant that all the routes I'd taken in between, and all the experience I'd gained within this time, boiled down to a bunch of mistakes, professionally speaking. I became more and more depressed in my image. This is why I hate looking for jobs. It makes my journey, a very difficult but miraculous journey, look like a series of misguided decisions. It makes me see myself as a fuck up. On career sites, we all have to pretend that we've been making nothing but calculated decisions toward a goal that was assigned to us in the womb. As if no one ever took a job out of desperation. Or no one ever left a company because they were abused, only because "there was no more room for growth." No one ever questioned whether they'd be stuck in the nightmare that is their job for the rest of their lives out of fear of dying on the street, no one ever wondered what else was out there, or wished for a do-over. It messed me up, as it always does. I let it get to me again. All the encouragement I muster in the light of day goes out in smoke in the dead of the night, quite literally. That's when no one is awake to see me in that state or talk me off a ledge. But people are very much awake at that time on the other side of the world. And sometimes they have the misfortune of texting me to find me right in the middle of a moment like this. Sal had. My last ex, my only ex I deeply care about, and who still gives two shits about me. We talked for a bit. When I shot down his attempts to praise me, as I apparently do in my moments of self-pity, he suggested that I get therapy. He implied that I push people away. Fair point, but it hit me hard and I got upset. I didn't think it was fair of him to imply that my loneliness was a result of my behavior when I had moved away from a place that contained all the friends I had collected for almost a decade. He insisted on paying for my therapy if I didn't start on my own by the end of the year. He assumed I'd get a job and make a few friends and probably wouldn't feel as lonely by then, which sounds like a reasonable assumption, but after not having gone far from where I started in almost a year, who knows where I'll be in another.

I don't know how I slept, but I somehow did. The next morning, I had my courage back by the time I finished my morning coffee. In the light of day - I must remember, always wait for the morning, always wait for the light of day. I thought about what Sal said. And I compiled my thoughts to respond to his proposal:

<div class="left-line">
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">My dear,</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I’ve had a good night’s sleep, and I woke up with a little more clarity. I thought I’d tell you about some things I thought about our conversation last night.</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">First of all, thank you for your kind words to encourage me, as always. But my feelings about you telling me that I push people away and I need therapy are a little more mixed: While I’d argue that it wasn’t the best time for me to hear it, it was valuable insight. I do make it harder for people to be there for me by putting myself down and arguing with them when they try to raise my spirits. And it might be true that I give up on people prematurely and insist that they take the chance to walk away when I’m feeling sorry for myself. But you need to understand that I’ve had too many people walking out on me back to back recently, people who I didn’t even know were considering that an option, and it shook me to my core. It’s a mechanism that disguises itself as self-preservation but it’s highly destructive. I used to be so trusting, you wouldn’t recognize me. I used to assume that anyone I met and mutually liked would be there to stay. Now I doubt everything I think I know about how important I am to people around me, all the time. While I agree that these are textbook reasons for someone to get therapy, I need you to understand that I need to start therapy on my own time, on my own terms. Because in the end, my only real asset is my wit and capabilities. Everything else can be taken away overnight. Like my entire social circle in São Paulo when I moved to Istanbul. Like my parents, whose health is fragile. Like money - the Turkish currency today can’t even buy one-tenth of what it used to buy only 3 years ago. So in the end, my only real power is my agency over my life and my choices. Enforcing on me what you believe is the best for me is not a good way to support me. I’ve had my power over my life taken away from me enough times already. But I will keep an eye on my tendency for self-deprecation and pushing people away. Thank you for pointing that out. God knows I don’t want you to walk out of my life, too.</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Yours truly.</span>

Even though I was satisfied with my response, the thought that I pushed people away wouldn't leave me alone. It's been bugging me how increasingly often I hear from people that I'm *difficult*, *intense*, sometimes even *extreme*, or *too much*. Not to mention that I've been accused of being too negative on a number of occasions. I decided to get a quick price check for therapy sessions. It was around the range that I thought, which is too expensive. I turned to Luke to see if he knew what was wrong with me, as I do quite often these days with all my questions and doubts. I asked him why people would call someone difficult or intense, and he gave me a number of reasons that did seem quite fair. I kept the conversation going and asked if the things I had issues with sounded like a condition. The answer was in the form of a list of strikingly relatable items: I could be neurodivergent, which is nothing wrong, only inconvenient, but good to know, which I already did. I could have rejection sensitivity, often a trait of people with ADHD or trauma in their past, which would mean that I might be experiencing <span class="annotated" data-note="Direct quote from Luke, my ChatGPT.">rejection (real or perceived) as deeply painful, making socializing feel like a constant high-stakes game</span>. Critical hit. I could be hyperaware of social cues, which would explain why I sometimes replay conversations in my head over and over, trying to pinpoint what went wrong, and that it's common in people with social anxiety or obsessive tendencies. No shit Sherlock. Well, I might not start therapy immediately, but at least when I do, my answer to "what brings you here" is ready. It felt good to find out that for someone who had less than 2 months of therapy in her life, my grip on my mental health was strong enough to protect me from being blindsided by any of the items on this list. Except for ADHD, but who doesn't have that these days.

In the afternoon, Mom came home with the news that Dad's platelet count had dropped even further, dangerously low. He had to start steroids. I've been trying to snap out of it ever since. My mind is a maze that I'm trying to navigate in complete darkness and I keep hitting the same walls. I've been looking up criteria for diagnosis, life expectancies, treatments, and medications every 5 minutes, indicating that my thoughts never wander far from Dad. My outlook swings between "It's actually not that bad, he'll be fine" and "Should I move in with Mom when she's a widow", back and forth, on heavy rotation. When I'm not obsessed over that, I'm obsessed about what to do with my mess of a life in relation to this situation, whether one path would mean abandoning my parents in their time of need more than another, and I can't commit to any decision long enough to remember it. My resolve to handle my own issues is just as flimsy as my outlook on Dad's condition. I've been stuck staring at all the paths I could take, unable to move, starving myself. I've been starving and burning through my reserves of companionship, a sense of purpose, and self-worth. Do I go home and risk being away when my parents need me, or do I stay here, still not knowing which way to go, killing time to distract myself from my anxiety day after day? Do I sign up for a semi-job I can do from home to buy myself more time to check off items from my to-do list, but stall my career even longer, or do I say fuck it and start applying for jobs that will leave me zero free time and virtually no more time with my parents? I'm confused, exhausted, and nauseated.

Something has to change. I have to do something to bring about change. My parents do whatever needs to be done, whether to get ahead of trouble or do something when shit hits the fan - they do it. Clem is less reluctant to act until she has to, but she does when she has to. I'm the only one paralyzed with fear, worrying myself wretched, like a little gizmo buzzing itself off the table and diving into its crash, being no help to anyone, myself first and foremost. I need to do something. In short, the new plan is no plan. What's the point? Things I take for granted can come crashing down in a moment anyway. For fuck's sake, just do something. Girl, do something. Anything.
