<span class="text-body-credit">To Sal. Written on Aug 31st, 2023, inside a copy of "Sessiz Ev" / "Silent House" by Orhan Pamuk, first published in 1983.</span>

<div class="left-line">
<span class="text-body-quote">I read this book when I was way too young to understand the political nuances it carries, yet it stayed with me because of its mystical, well-written story."</span> So I leave it with you, my love, as a charm from a land far away, that is pretty on the surface, but filled with details that are only noticeable to those familiar with the millennia-old chaos that I call home. It's a combination of good literature, and strong, turbulent undercurrents, just like us.
