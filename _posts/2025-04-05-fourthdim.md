I think it's getting to be about time that I read <span class="annotated" data-note="1969 novel by Kurt Vonnegut. The excerpts below are from this book.">Slaughterhouse-Five</span> again. I've been observing a cross-cultural shift in the storytelling style lately. Every book, film, and series I pick up is built on a nonlinear narrative on a global scale. Are we disenchanted with the chronological order of events, or are we finally ready to admit that context matters? Or maybe jumping back and forth in the story comes more naturally to humans, as our brains are not exactly organized like drawers with labels on them. I can't remember what year something happened without remembering other things that happened that year. But this shift in narrative has more of a <span class="annotated" data-note="The extraterrestrial species described in the novel.">Tralfamadorian</span> feeling to it:

<div class="left-line">
<span class="text-body-quote">The creatures were friendly, and they could see in four dimensions. They pitied Earthlings for being able to see only three. … "All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance."</span>
</div>

If a film depicts a scene of a woman dressing her mother with Alzheimer's, why does that feel more wholesome when it's nested within another scene of the mother dressing her as a child? When the audience is on the verge of writing a character off for being a jerk to his kids, why are they almost swayed from their opinion when they find out that his father used to beat him every day? It's easy to pin the impact of jumping back and forth in the story on the romanticism of the past echoing in the present, but I think it's more than that. It's almost as if we earthlings are trying to imitate Tralfamadorian stories from our limited, three-dimensional view:

<div class="left-line">
<span class="text-body-quote">"There are no telegrams on Tralfamadore. But you're right: each clump of symbols is a brief, urgent message—describing a situation, a scene. We Tralfamadorians read them all at once, not one after the other. There isn't any particular relationship between all the messages, except that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time."</span>

It was Seth who got me reading Vonnegut. I don't think either of us expected that this novel would be so central to my philosophy later in life. A few weeks before he and I parted ways to head to our respective new continents, he had asked me if I could design a tattoo for him based on Slaughterhouse-Five. It took me some time to come up with an idea, and by the time I did, there was too much going on to allow me the time to design it. But come up with an idea, I did.

The bombing of Dresden in 1945 during World War II is a pivotal event to the novel. As shocking as it is to an earthling that nearly 4000 tons of explosives and incendiaries should be dropped on a single city in less than 12 hours, from a Tralfamadorian point of view, the bombing of Dresden was always going to happen, it always is happening, and it always will have happened. Hence my idea for Seth's tattoo: A bombed and burned Dresden in a snow globe with bombs instead of snowflakes, allowing the moment of destruction raining on the city to be recreated at will with one shake of the globe. Because the moment of its happening is eternal, and eternally happening. "<span class="annotated" data-note="This is the sentence that is uttered after every instance of death in the novel.">So it goes.</span>"
