He's standing in front of the bathroom mirror, wearing a bordeaux dressing gown trimmed with black lace, that ends just below his hips. Hair flowing down to his shoulders, freshly let down after being tucked in a claw clip all day, wavy, and such a wild red, like a waterfall made of wine fire. In that moment he can barely contain himself, and he looks, so gloriously, himself.

I don't know what to do with this. I'm certainly infected by his joy, but somewhat befuddled. I've never had someone like him conquering my heart before, with stunning legs protruding from such a garment, over which, in stark contrast, his broad back and shoulders pose a forceful presence on me, like mountains. This is uncharted territory for me. While I've never paid any particular effort to shining, I'm certainly not used to being outglamoured. In comparison to his, my personality, which I've cultivated all my life to radiate the comforts of the unadorned, sometimes just feels shabby and worn out instead. Yet I can't help but feel mesmerized, as if I'm looking at the bright-colored feathers of a peacock.
