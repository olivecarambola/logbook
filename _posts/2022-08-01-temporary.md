scaffolding

do you remember ever seeing one?  
have you ever been one?

nothing is done without support  
to form an equation  
you start with theoretical pieces  
you create a fictional world  
so it would deliver your story  
you can't build a ship  
if you start in the sea  

and once all is done  
when the ship is sent out  
the story crescendos to its end  
the equation glimmering on the page  
and the building towers over you in the sun  
it's torn down

no one remembers the scaffolding  
it was never meant to stay  
or to be seen  
it even sounds belittling  
it cracks the beauty  
forgotten in their glory  
little scaffolding.
