Stories and musings of a woman who can't decide between two diametrically opposed cultures, can't commit to a vocation, can't seem to locate her people, and can't land on a style of conduct in her affairs to save her life.

Contains prose, poetry, fiction, quoted text, translated text, and credited images. These bits and pieces do not follow a narrative, do not feature main or recurring characters, and can only promise to frustrate the reader.

No AI-generated stuff here. Unless, of course, David Foster Wallace or Kurt Vonnegut somehow had access to generative AI tools back in the day and it snuck in within quotes, i.e., I can't speak for the owners of the credited content. No AI translations either. I write mostly in English, and all translations are done the old-fashioned way and credited to their owners. I write to deal with life, not to create content.
