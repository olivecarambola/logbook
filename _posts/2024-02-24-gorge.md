Stomach vs Brain 2 days into the unemployment that came after 5 years in an abusive work environment:

<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.65em;">Stomach: "Sweets, again?"</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.65em;">Brain: "This time with black tea, because it's the perfect time for it in the afternoon. The light is just right."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.65em;">Stomach: "But you were having coffee with sweets just before you started this meal, the one that you've just finished."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.65em;">Brain: "Yeah, I don't know what to tell you. This is happening."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.65em;">Stomach, crying: "I can't take this no more."</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.65em;">Brain: "Yeah, yeah, can you weep and digest at the same time?"</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.65em;">Stomach: "Fineâ€¦ Hic! I hate you."</span>
