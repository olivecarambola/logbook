To be vulnerable is, more often than not, to be hurt, rejected, disappointed, sad, and unsatisfied. If I can be all those things, and I still keep going, surviving, and sometimes even thriving, that means I'm also resilient. It means that I'm stronger.

But every day, I have to fight not to break. Every day, my immediate surroundings show me that I'm insignificant and teach me new levels of humility. I thought that I'd grow a thicker skin and have things rolling off my back by now. But I didn't. Instead, I learned to get comfortable with discomfort, even misery.

People often think that being a survivor automatically means you are now a badass. But it just means you got out alive. Thanks, inspirational speakers everywhere. In the meantime, I've been astonishing people by making lemons from lemonade for decades.
