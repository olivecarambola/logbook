<span class="text-body-credit">“Frida Kahlo to Marty McConnell” by Marty McConnell, published in *Salt Hill*, no. 23, 2009.</span>

<span class="text-body-quote">leaving is not enough; you must  
stay gone. train your heart  
like a dog. change the locks  
even on the house he’s never  
visited. you lucky, lucky girl.  
you have an apartment  
just your size. a bathtub  
full of tea. a heart the size  
of Arizona, but not nearly  
so arid. don’t wish away  
your cracked past, your  
crooked toes, your problems  
are papier mache puppets  
you made or bought because the vendor  
at the market was so compelling you just  
had to have them. you had to have him.  
and you did. and now you pull down  
the bridge between your houses.  
you make him call before  
he visits. you take a lover  
for granted, you take  
a lover who looks at you  
like maybe you are magic. make  
the first bottle you consume  
in this place a relic. place it  
on whatever altar you fashion  
with a knife and five cranberries.  
don’t lose too much weight.  
stupid girls are always trying  
to disappear as revenge. and you  
are not stupid. you loved a man  
with more hands than a parade  
of beggars, and here you stand. heart  
like a four-poster bed. heart like a canvas.  
heart leaking something so strong  
they can smell it in the street.</span>
