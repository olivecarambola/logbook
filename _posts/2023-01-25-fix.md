I know how to find magic for myself. I put on a black miniskirt and a smug little smile and go out on the street and walk into the dimmest dive bar. I locate the most emotionally-unavailable-looking cuteser and sign myself up for a rollercoaster ride. Whenever I see an opening I break the rules and see who's looking. That's how I find and befriend eccentric people. They open up to me and I collect patterns. Shimmery golden patterns in the big mess they know themselves as. A pattern that puts them in the best possible light with the quirkiest spin on their flaws, and makes them look perfect as they are. Then I reflect it back to them. Some instinctively know to keep a healthy dose and they're the ones who stick around for the long run. They call you in times of distress and you can't help but feel amazed at the miracle a little time and effort from two people can work - one moment you were strangers, and next, you get to be someone they trust with their vulnerability. But some get addicted, and every addiction runs its course. Eventually they realize I didn't solve their problems, I just made them look good. But it's not all good. So they, now a little uneasy, "take a step back", and I'm left to weigh my gain against my losses. It's a simple trade, and who's to say it's not a fair exchange. They choose to come in, they choose to leave, and I move on to the next magical creature. You can make magic out of anything. You just have to put yourself in the most thought-provoking setting and call it home. Find a roommate who has a soft side for mood elevators. Better if they have a personality disorder, because that, my friend, is a person who understands why someone would strive to function with their dysfunction. They know that you can't judge a person for grabbing the wrong hand when they're drowning. So you drown together and enable each other's coping mechanisms and self-treatment routines. What's the harm in that. You can purchase magic. It can be as easy as making your home into where you wish you could live when you were a kid. Or spend your money on the sweets you wanted to buy back then. And enjoy the delayed gratification with interest and no guilt. You can't make it into a habit though, then it'll lose its magic and become just another thing to deal with. Other times it's trickier than that. You need to get good at observing yourself and find the connections between occurrences and the trips they bump you into. The things that make you feel that surge of magic and set you a-buzzing. Sometimes, when you follow the chain of events to their origin, there lies a product that you can buy for next to nothing. An article. A book. A writer's all books. A song. The right content source. The right music provider. A genre of films. A video that makes you sigh with insight and amazement. A lamp that illuminates your walls and your self-image just the right way. A sundress that brushes against your legs in the breeze ever so slightly and makes you feel lighter than a feather. You need to make room for magic. I look for opportunities to take the nicest walks. I try to catch the sweetest night air, the scarcest foot traffic, and the most open state of mind. I stand still in the shower and allow myself the time to do nothing but feel the water on my skin. I bask in the sun. I refuse to live in a house where I can't dance in my underwear while I'm making coffee or blast music while I'm in the shower. I make choices that grant my life flexibility and space. That way, when the inspiration strikes I get a decent chance to do it justice. You can't do that if your life is chock-full of responsibilities and over-scheduled with activities and planned to the minute for the next couple of decades. I also run the risk of growing restless, developing addictions, feeling left behind, getting stuck in a rut, and enduring all kinds of chakra blockages from time to time, but if you stick with it you usually find that it's just what you need to push through. You find that a dry spell is your mind's way of telling you that you're done with this stage of your life, you've gotten all that you can squeeze out of this experience. You've immersed yourself in it, gobbled up all of it, basked in your moment of glory, sat with the aftertaste long enough, and now the dopamine clouds are dispersing, creative juices are down to a trickle, and the post production crew is asking for their leave. So now you're ready to figure out what's next, grow a new layer and get back your spark. You can put yourself in the way of magic. You never pass up a chance to hear a good story. You get acquainted with the right neighborhoods. Mix in with the right crowd to keep the magic close. You look around and look up every chance you get. Sometimes the sky is a color you've never seen before. Sometimes the moon stirs up something in you. Sometimes things align and create a composition, and you find yourself looking at a perfect frame. Sometimes you hear the wind in the trees half a block away, watch the leaves glide down, and you know that in only a few moments that breeze is going to enter the room, lift the curtains, and wash the air inside the house from window to window. You move into an old house that has its own ways that you have to figure out. You sit in the living room eyeballing your begonias on a Saturday afternoon and watch the rain approaching in a South American dream. You find paths to walk home that stretch under trees which, come spring, bloom so abundantly and shamelessly that the scent pulls you right out of your head, stops you in your tracks, makes you look up, and floods your senses with the vision before you. Even when you're at the bottom of your deepest pit, trapped in the stormiest of thoughts, walking home on nothing but muscle memory. You pass by a garden that sports the proverbial lemon tree from that song by Fool's Garden. You notice a house whose roof and an attic window look just like how you imagined the one in a book from your childhood would look. You spot a shrub of your favorite flower. If finding the same kind of flower in your street, of the exact shade of blue you remember, 30 years and half a world away from your childhood isn't magic, I don't know what is. You see a man walk into an old shop with habitual steps and understand the poem someone once read to you in bed, a poem about a man who went to the *tabacaria* across the street. You travel. You keep looking until you find places with their own spiritual presence strong enough to command you. You be quiet and listen to what they have to say. You don't believe in God but you ask people about their god. Not people who only follow their family's traditions, but people who work on their faith. You listen and withdraw wisdom from their magic. You witness the rare sight of a person helping out a fellow human being they hardly know because they recognize the kind of misery the other is going through and they wish someone had helped them when they were trapped in the same nightmare. You find people who are passionate about something, anything, and watch them talking about it, or better yet, doing it. You watch them come alive. You pay attention to the interactions between people who've known each other for a long time and marvel at the familiarity and the history they share, the intricacies of their conversation, their playful little old dance. You don't need to respond, you don't need to react or participate, you just need to be present. You can make yourself into magic. You make someone's day a lot less difficult with only a moment of consideration. You teach someone something new. You watch a tutorial and change your laptop's hardware settings. You surprise someone with your kindness. You impress someone with your courage. You talk to other people and realize that the insight you acquired about the nature of things through years of studying and overnighting and attempting and failing wasn't always there. It's there because you internalized a certain type of knowledge over time by hammering your thinking patterns ruthlessly and repeatedly into a system that makes sense to you. It's there because you've put it out in the world simply by *being*. And sometimes magic approaches you. Sometimes you need to let your guard down and let a pro get near your heart knowing all that you know, just so he can briefly worship you, play you, and sucker-punch you before dropping you for his next conquest. Because sometimes that's what you need to be pulled out of your coma and dragged back into the land of the living. Sometimes you kiss a boy until you're addicted to his smell. All you have to do is to let him in and not question whether he'll stay. You talk to him and indulge yourself in him until his skin on yours feels like your own. Until you're alone together and he leans in and you realize you haven't been breathing right since the last time you saw each other. Those are the ones for which, sooner or later, you're gonna pay. So you might as well enjoy it while it lasts. Sometimes people surprise you, most of the time they don't. Best not to dwell on the latter if you don't want all your magic to be wasted on the obvious. I don't trust people who don't have rituals. Every magic junkie worth their salt has rituals. Some light a candle and kneel before a shrine every night, some cultivate bonsai trees, some roll a joint, and some stand at the center of a raging party to get to that state of calm, the center, the clarity. I get my fix wherever I can. I'm a free agent. I don't buy, I rent. I don't pay subscription, I pay upfront in cash. I leave nothing behind that I don't mind living without. Because after all my big investments have gone belly up, this is all I can afford. Because no one I would've gone all in with asked me to stay, nor has anyone I have gone all in for wanted to stick around. So what if I don't want any more trouble. So what if I stopped expecting things to last. *C'est la vie*. What else am I supposed to do, live without magic?
